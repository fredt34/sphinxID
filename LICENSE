GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 0. This License applies to any program or other work
   which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
   saying it can be distributed under the terms of this
   General Public License. The "Program", below,
   refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
   on the Program" means either the Program or any
   work containing the Program or a portion of it,
   either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is
   addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
are not covered by this License; they are outside its
scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,
but output from the Program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
of having been made by running the Program).

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
   Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
   provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
   on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact
   all notices stating that this License applies to the
   Program and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
   other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
   along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
   portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program,
   and copy and distribute such modifications or work under
   the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet
   all of these conditions:

  a) You must cause the modified files to carry
     prominent notices stating that you changed the files
     and the date of any change.

  b) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed
     at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
     this License.

  c) If a portion of the modified work is derived from
     the Program, you must include the Program's source
     code in your distribution. Alternatively, you may
     include a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to provide the Program's source code.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work
   based on it, under Section 2) in object code or
   executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
   above provided that you also do one of the following:

  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-
     readable source code, which must be distributed under
     the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above.

  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
     three years, to give any third party the source code.

  c) You must provide access to the source code through a
     network server at no charge.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
   Program except as expressly provided under this License.
   Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or
distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you
   have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you
   permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
   derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if
you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program),
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work
   based on the Program), the recipient automatically
   receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
   distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
   and conditions. You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
   granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
   compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation
   of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
   limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you
   (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
   contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
   cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
   obligations under this License and any other pertinent
   obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
   would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
   Program by all those who receive copies directly or
   indirectly through you, then the only way you could
   satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
   entirely from distribution of the Program.

8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into
   other free programs whose distribution conditions are
   incompatible with this License, you must either
   remove these parts from the Program, or rename it with
   a different name, or else make the whole Program
   available under the terms of the GNU General Public
   License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
   new versions of the GNU General Public License from time
to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to
   the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns. Each version is given
   a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
   that a certain numbered version of this License "or any
   later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that
   numbered version or of any later version published by the
   Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
   specify a version number of this License, you may
   choose any version ever published by the Free Software
   Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate portions of this Program
    into other programs whose distribution conditions are
    incompatible with this License, you must either
    remove those portions or rename the Program, or else
    distribute the entire Program under the terms of the
    GNU General Public License.

11. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to
    the maximum extent permissible and the remaining
    provisions of this License shall remain in full force
    and effect.

12. This License is intended to make sure that you have
    the freedom to share and change all versions of the
    program. By contrast, the GNU General Public License
    aims to guarantee your freedom to share and change
    free softwareâ€”to make sure the software is free for
    all its users. This License, therefore, ensures that
    the Program is free for all its users.

13. The GNU General Public License is a free software
    license that guarantees end users the freedom to run,
    study, share, and modify the software. The licenses
    are designed to be simple and easy to understand.

14. If you have any questions about this License, please
    contact the Free Software Foundation at

End of Terms and Conditions.
